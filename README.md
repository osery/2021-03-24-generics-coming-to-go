# Golang Generics Examples

Set of Golang generics examples for a Pure Storage event **Coffee to Go** on the 24th of March 2021.

These follow the language change proposal: https://blog.golang.org/generics-proposal. At the time of
writing, you can run the code by pasting into go2go Golang playground:
https://go2goplay.golang.org/.

Alternatively, you can build the `dev.go2go` or `dev.typeparams` branch of golang yourself. I
haven't tried this though.
